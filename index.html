        <header><b>The Highs and Lows of a career in Sales (and why the lows won)</b>
            <p>
                Sales can be a truly incredible career, but it is not for everyone.
 
                I've had a 10(ish) year journey in sales, and while I've enjoyed most of it I feel like it's time for aa change.
 
                <br> below are some highlights of my career up to this point as well as the reasons I decided it was time for a change.

                        Working in car sales was &#60 fun than working with HTML. Frankly working in car sales was the worst job I ever had. 
                        While I did enjoy speaking to customers about what they would like in a new car, 
                            certain aspects of how the dealership wanted negotiations to be carried out made my position at the dealership untenable.

                        Telecommunications sales is an overly fancy way of saying cell phone sales. After the car dealership I had thought about getting out of sales altogether (and probably should have) but a friend mentioned that AT&T store paid well so I looked into it.
                        <br>It was not what I expected
                        
                        <br>Working at AT&T was oddly intense. The money was fantastic but the pressure to sell and hit numbers was also ever present. Some people thrived on the high intensity environment and flourished, others wanted a more relaxed role and moved on.

                    <b>Mortgages</b>
                    <img src = "images/html3.jpg" alt = "mortgage paperwork">
                    <p>
                        After leaving AT&T I decided to pursue a sales career that could potentially be a career. For reference a talented loan officer can make over 100k in a year. In order to work into this role however,
                        one needs to usually work in a supporting fashion for about 8 months. While I did not particularly enjoy the work nor did I make to much money I did learn valuable outreach and long term sales skills. Two things that would allow me to differentiate myself in my next sales job.

                    <p>
                        After getting out of Mortgages I went back into cell phone sales since I knew how to be succsesful in that industry already.
